# Progress Tracking

## What Works

**Nothing yet** - Project is in initialization phase.

## What's Left to Build

### Foundation (Day 1)
- [ ] Project setup (React + Vite, Express)
- [ ] Basic chat UI with Vercel AI SDK
- [ ] Socratic prompting system
- [ ] Firebase integration

### Input & Parsing (Day 2)
- [ ] Image upload UI
- [ ] Image parsing with OpenAI Vision
- [ ] Math rendering with KaTeX
- [ ] Conversation persistence in Firestore

### Whiteboard (Day 3)
- [ ] Canvas component foundation
- [ ] Step visualization rendering
- [ ] Drawing lock/unlock mechanism
- [ ] Basic drawing tools (pen, eraser)
- [ ] Canvas state management

### Polish & Deployment (Day 4-5)
- [ ] Color picker & clear button
- [ ] Problem type testing
- [ ] UI polish & responsiveness
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Vercel deployment
- [ ] Demo video

### Optional (P1/P2)
- [ ] Whiteboard enhancements (pan/zoom, undo/redo)
- [ ] Handwritten math recognition
- [ ] Voice interface (TTS/STT)

## Current Status

**Phase:** Project Initialization  
**Completion:** ~0%

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Created project structure
- ✅ Initialized package.json files
- ✅ Created memory bank documentation

### In Progress
- None

### Next Up

## Known Issues

None yet - project just starting.

## Problem Types to Test (Once Built)

1. Simple Arithmetic: "What is 24 × 15?"
2. Linear Equations: "Solve for x: 3x - 7 = 14"
3. Systems of Equations: "Solve: 2x + y = 10, x - y = 2"
4. Geometry: "Find the area of a triangle with base 8 and height 5"
5. Word Problems: "If Sarah has 3 times as many apples as Tom, and together they have 24 apples, how many does each have?"
6. Quadratic Equations: "Solve: x² - 5x + 6 = 0"
7. Multi-step Problems: "A rectangle's length is 3 more than twice its width. If the perimeter is 36, find the dimensions."

## Success Metrics (To Track)

- [ ] Successfully guides through 5+ problem types without giving direct answers
- [ ] Maintains conversation context across multi-turn dialogues
- [ ] Whiteboard renders step visualizations correctly
- [ ] Drawing lock/unlock works smoothly
- [ ] Image parsing accuracy >90% for printed problems
- [ ] Voice interface works (if implemented)
- [ ] All P0 features complete and polished
